JsToolbox
============================================

JsToolbox is just my toolbox of functions that I find useful

It is not intended to be a new awesome must use framework with coffee or caffeine reference whatsoever. It's just a bunch of a functions that I want to have in my pocket.

btw: *yessss* you can use it in any way you want as long you're not using it against humanity and *yesss* it is written with tdd and *yesss* all tests are included.

Cheers
